To evaluate the performance correlation of our GPU-SST model, versus both real
hardware and the existing GPGPU-Sim memory system implementation an execution
time correlation is done on the vectorAdd benchmark from the CUDA SDK. Figure
\ref{fig:titanv_result} shows the results of this timing analysis. The most
accurate GPGPU-Sim timing model is reasonably accurate (within 25\% of the
hardware results), however GPU-SST is much closer to real hardware, showing
just and 8\% deviation from a silicon Nvidia Titan V card.
