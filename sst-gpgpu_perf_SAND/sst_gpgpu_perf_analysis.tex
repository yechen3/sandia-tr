This chapter is devoted to an analysis of the functional and timing models in
SST when using the GPU component as a part of a generalized compute node. Since
GPUs in HPC function solely as co-processors, functionally executing GPU-enabled
binaries requires the CPU to initialize and launch kernels of work to the GPU.
Figure~\ref{fig:sst_volta} shows the general simulation model used for the evaluation.
The Command Link and Data Link serve as the transport mechanism for the CPU (host)
to launch and coordinate work with the GPU (device). The other components in each
model can be tailored to fit any host and device that one wishes to model.
