This report has detailed the first phase of the SST-GPU project, where the
execution-driven functional and performance model of a GPU had been integrated
SST. Initial results demonstrate significant coverage of applications. The next phase of the project will
focus on further disaggregating the GPU to enable truly scaled GPU performance
in a multi-process MPI simulation.
