We use GPGPU-Sim simulator as a library to provide CTA scheduling and GPU core
functionality. GPU Scheduler and SM Group components invokes on GPGPU-Sim library
(libcudart.so) with internal API calls.

To support SST-GPU to run on one thread, on multiple threads or on multiple
processes on one node or multiple nodes, we refactor GPGPU-Sim simulator to avoid
static and global variables. Instead, GPU components construct a GPU context data
structure before using GPGPU-Sim library so that each component can keep an
individual context. Moreover, we design an option inside the context data structure
to manage the library under scheduler mode or SM mode. GPGPU-Sim library works as
a CTA scheduler to issue CTAs and works as a group of GPU cores under SM mode.
