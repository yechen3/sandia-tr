To support the GPGPU-Sim functional model, a number of the simulator's overloaded
CUDA Runtime API calls were updated. A number of functions that originally assumed
the application and simulator were within same address space now support them being
decoupled. Initialization functions, such as \texttt{\textunderscore \textunderscore
cudaRegisterFatBinary}, now take paths to the original application to obtain the PTX
assembly of CUDA kernels.

Supporting the functional model of GPGPU-Sim also requires transferring values
from the CPU application to the GPU memory system. This is solved by leveraging
the inter-process communication tunnel framework from SST-Core, as shown in
\ref{fig:gpu_transfer_model}. Chunks of memory are transferred from the CPU
application to the GPU memory system at the granularity of a page (4KiB). The
transfer of pages is a blocking operation, therefore all stores to the GPU
memory system must be completed before another page is transferred or another
API call is processed.

To model GPU performance, the memory system of the public GPGPU-Sim is
completely removed. Instead, all accesses to GPU memory are sent though SST
links to the MemHierarchy interface. As Figure \ref{fig:gpu_mem_model} shows, a
multi-level cache hierarchy is simulated with the shared L2 sliced between
different memory partitions, each with its own memory controller. Several
backend timing models have been configured and tested, including SimpleMem,
SimpleDRAM, TimingDRAM, and CramSim \cite{healy2017}; CramSim will be used to
model the HBM stacks in the more detailed performance models. We have created an
initial model for the GPU system similar to that found in an Nvidia Volta. The
configuration for the GPU, CramSim and Network components is shown in Listing
\ref{lst:sst_config}.
