This report described the final integration of phase one of the SST-GPU project.
Functional validation against the Kokkos Kernels unit tests shows that the GPU
component can successfully run more than 60\% of the tests with a path to reach
a coverage of greater than 90\%. Correlation with the Waterman V100 testbed is
excellent, showing 4-22\% error in the runtime for the applications considered.
The next phase of the project will focus on further disaggregating the GPU to
enable truly scaled GPU performance in a multi-process MPI simulation.
