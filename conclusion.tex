This report described the final integration of the SST-GPU project.
Functional validation against the Kokkos Kernels unit tests shows that the GPU
component can successfully run more than 48.9\% of the tests. Correlation with the Waterman V100 testbed is
excellent, showing XX\% error in the runtime for the applications considered.
The final phase of the project has involved parallelizing the scheduler and
groups of SMs, dubbed {\em SM Groups}, using multi-threaded.
Initial performance results demonstrate good scalability
using default scheduling policies with additional opportunities to improve
parallel scheduling performance.
