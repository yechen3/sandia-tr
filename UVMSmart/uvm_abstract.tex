CPU/GPU Heterogeneous compute platforms is prevalent now and a programming model
specified for this heterogeneous computing is more important for the 
performance as well as programmability. Shared unified address space between the 
heterogeneous units is a programming model to eliminate the need to explicitly manage 
the movement of data between CPU and GPU.

GPU vendors, such as AMD and NVIDIA, have released software-managed runtimes that can provide programmers the illusion of unified CPU and GPU memory by automatically migrating data in and out of the GPU memory. However, this runtimes support is not included in the GPGPU-Sim \cite{gpgpu_sim}, a very commonly used framework models the features of a modern graphics processor that are relevant to non-graphics applications. To reflect this substantial advance, UVMSmart \cite{9139797} was proposed, which extended GPGPU-Sim 3.x to incorporate the modelling of on-demand pageing and data migration. This report 
discusses the integration of UVMSmart and GPGPU-Sim 4.0 and the modifications to 
improve simulation performance and accuracy.
